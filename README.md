# START Hack 2021 - Mercedes-Benz Case

### Case Introduction
The “traditional” Mercedes-Benz dealerships are now fully digital. Even today, they offer customers more than just the opportunity to buy a vehicle. The dealership of the future should surprise customers, offer individualised highlights and, ideally, appeal to all their senses in an exciting way. With that in mind, we also want our dealerships to offer a high-quality brand and buying experience in terms of sound. We’re looking for an innovative sound control system that will wow our customers, offer them magical moments and go far beyond a normal media player.

### Case Pitch
You can find our Pitch Video [here](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34119356/111480600-75d5ea00-8732-11eb-8016-e40db5f8ab3f.mp4).

### Deep Dive Slides
You can find the Deep Dive Slides [here](https://github.com/START-Global/MercedesBenz-STARTHACK21/files/6158467/Musik.im.Showroom_finale.Version.pdf).

### Further Information
* In general, your product should handle the audio-related part of the dealership experience. This can be done by generating sounds, playing music obtained from a 3rd party service or from predefined playlists, or in other ways. The only thing important is that there is no silence. 
* Your product should also take into account that there are different audio zones in a showroom (waiting area, lounge, different vehicle segments). 
* As mentioned in the Deep Dive Slides, the hardware in our showrooms (audio devices and screens) is designed to run HTML5-based content. For the scope of this case you can assume that what is shown in a browser window will be displayed on a tablet or screen, and the audio output will be redirected to the speakers installed in the showroom. To handle multiple devices at once, run multiple browser windows. 
* If you wish to do so you can also implement a native app to be run in kiosk mode on the iPads in the showroom. However, this is not a requirement. 
* You do not have to worry about interfaces to our backend services (such as vehicle information and additional data), we will address the specifics of these API's with you after the challenge once the decision has been made to further explore your idea.

### Judging Criteria
We are following the standard Judging Criteria of START Hack: 
* __Complexity & Technical Sophistication:__ How technically impressive is the solution? Were any nifty techniques, algorithms or combination of different components used? Are appropriate services, technologies and infrastructure applied (e.g. cloud computing, AI, databases)?
* __Design:__ Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface? Is the user experience intuitive? Depending on the project, you might have to look at how beautiful the graphics are, how good the human-computer interaction is or how well the flow of the solution is designed.
* __Viability:__ How significant and relevant is the prototype's use case to the tackled business problem? Is it something people would actually use? Does it fulfill a real need people have?
* __Feasibility:__ Is the hack usable in its current state? Did the team achieve everything they wanted? Could the prototype scale as a real solution with multiple users?
* __Creativity & Innovation:__ How creative or innovative is the idea behind the prototype? How does the team deal with the awareness of other attempts that try to solve the same problem and how did the team position their hackathon entry? Does it pull something off that hasn’t been pulled off before?
* __Presentation:__ Was the team able to explain what the prototype actually did? Did the presentation and demo show how their hack has fulfilled the judging criteria? Did the team communicate the essence of why they did what they did and why it was important?
